# Predicting CRS after CAR-T cell therapy in B-ALL patients 🧫

## PICO

- **P (Population)**: Patients with B cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) undergoing CD19 CAR-T cell therapy
- **I (Intervention)**: CAR-T cell therapy, a groundbreaking immunotherapy that genetically modifies a patient's T cells to recognise and attack cancer cells
- **C (Comparison)**: None
- **O (Outcome)**: Occurrence of sCRS (severe CRS) and the highest potential CRS level a patient may reach.

## Business value: company / stakeholder (1/2)

Goal: *enhance the management* CRS in patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy

- by predicting likelihood and severity of CRS
- allows implementing timely interventions, such as closer monitoring, preemptive medication, or adjusting therapy plans

## Business value: company / stakeholder (2/2)

### 🏁 KPIs:

- Patient outcomes: improvement in overall patient outcomes, including reduced incidence of severe CRS
- Healthcare utilisation: reduction in need for IC or emergency interventions related to CRS
- Time to intervention: reduction in the time between CAR T-cell infusion and the initiation of interventions for CRS
- Patient satisfaction: increased patient satisfaction scores or quality of life


## Business value: project

###  🏁 KPIs:

- Prediction Accuracy: percentage of correct predictions (model reliability)
- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): ability to correctly identify patients who will develop severe CRS
- Specificity (True Negative Rate): model's effectiveness in correctly identifying patients who will not develop severe CRS

## 💻 A predcitive model based on published patient data

- $Y$: CRS severity (ordinal)
- $X_1$ - $X_n$: `{r} length(colnames(dat_crs))-1` patient characteristics:

```{r}
names(dat_crs)[1:length(colnames(dat_crs))-1]

# Antipsychotic medication maintenance vs. dose-reduction/discontinuation in first episode psychosis 💊 

## PICO

- **P (Population)**: Patients with first episode psychosis
- **I (Intervention)**: Maintenance antipsychotic medication
- **C (Comparison)**: Dose-reduction/discontinuation of antipsychotic medication
- **O (Outcome)**: Relapse of psychosis. HERE: work status, income, and healthcare utilisation

## Business value: company / stakeholder (1/2)

Goal: *improve the management* of first episode psychosis

- by identifying patients who may benefit from dose-reduction/discontinuation of antipsychotic medication
- allows for a more personalised treatment approach, potentially reducing side effects and improving quality of life
- allowing better capacity planning

## Business value: company / stakeholder (2/2)

### 🏁 KPIs:

- Patient outcomes: improvement in return to work and income
- Healthcare utilisation: knowing upfront who will use more healthcare in the future -> early interventions and capacity planning
- Patient satisfaction: increased patient satisfaction scores or quality of life

## Business value: project

###  🏁 KPIs:

- Percentage of correct predictions (model reliability)
- Model's effectiveness in correctly identifying patients who return to work (income categories), and use more/less healthcare

## 💻 A predcitive model based on patient & CBS data

- $Y$: Work status OR income level OR healthcare utilisation (ordinal)
- $X_1$ - $X_n$: patient characteristics from HAMLETT trial and CBS data
